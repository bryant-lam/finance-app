# Finance App Project ðŸ“ˆ

This project was created using the (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)MERN Stack and deployed using Vercel. It is my first project creating a full-stack application using React. I followed and learned from an in-depth tutorial provided down below.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: React is a popular JavaScript library for building dynamic websites by mixing HTML code within JavaScript.

- **Material-UI**: Materials-UI is a React UI Framework that uses Google's Material Design Guidelines to create modern web applications. 

- **TypeScript**: TypeScript offered additional static typing options and interface extensions.

- **Express**: Express possesses utilities for handling HTTP requests and responses. It simplifies the process of backend to frontend and provides scalability.

- **Fly.io**: Fly.io is a cloud platform used for the backend. It offers load balancing, serverless computing, and low-latency application delivery. 

- **Vite**: Vite is a development server and build tool that helped me visually debug the application along with Chrome DevTools during development.

- **Node.js**: Node.js is the run-time environment that allowed me to run JavaScript without a browser for server-side code. By default, I used npm the node packet manager for installation, dependency management, and actions from the command line.

## Learning Experience

Creating this full-stack application gave me a greater understanding of how technologies work together. Throughout the development process, I gained valuable insights into:

- **React**: I got comfortable using React Hooks and creating components. I am slowly getting familiar with the combination of HTML + JavaScript.

- **TypeScript**: I gained a firm understanding of extending interfaces using Material-UI for more color palettes.

- **ESLint**: I became familiar with debugging through ESLint and made it a habit to create code with 0 errors.

- **Node.js**: I learned different commands using npm and created a React environment from scratch.
